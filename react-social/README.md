# Tinosocial React App

This project uses Create React App to bootstrap the development environment.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, optimizing it for best performance.
- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation.** It removes the single build dependency, allowing full control over configuration files and dependencies.
